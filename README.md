I am using this excellent app to keep track of [Medical Medium supplements](https://www.medicalmedium.com/preferred/supplements) from his newest book: [Cleanse To Heal](https://www.medicalmedium.com/) but I had 

The Medical Medium supplements can be taken almost whenever throughout the day, so the schedules in the app are not too important for me.


### Small fixes

* Supplements are sorted alphabetically in Agenda and Confirm activity
* Removed many icons from the Agenda view and enlargened `RecyclerView` supplement texts for easier display
  * The pill icons are not useful for me
* Fixed the height bug in the ConfirmActivity `RecyclerView` by not using a collapsing toolbar
  * The last item gets cut off apparently on many items
* Also removed a few fancy materialish-animations

All of those are super quick dirty-hotfixes for myself, so take care ;)
